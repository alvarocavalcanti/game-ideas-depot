{"name":"Game Ideas Depot","tagline":"A repoitory of my game-design ideas. Free for all!","body":"# Game Ideas Depot\r\n\r\n## What's This?\r\n\r\nThis repo was created to both store and share some game design concepts I have.\r\n\r\n## But Why Share Your *Great Game Idead (tm)*?\r\n\r\nWell, for starters, ideas are like caterpillar eggs. [A thousand are laid, a hundred hatch and only a handful become butterflies](http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/614/the_idea_is_not_the_.php). Also, as we discussed on an excellent (and free!) [game design online course](https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/) a game idea is only the tip of the iceberg, a finished game stands leagues away from the idea and involves **a lot** of work.\r\n\r\nIn the end I would love to see where this goes. And I'm sure anywhere it goes would be fine.\r\n\r\nAlso, this initiative isn't anything new in the gamedev community. The greatest example I can recall, which was my **true inspiration**, is the [Game Prototype Challenge](http://lunar.lostgarden.com/labels/prototyping%20challenge.html). A series of posts from the **remarkable** [Lost Garden](http://www.lostgarden.com/) blog, by Daniel Cook. Go check it out. Oh, and along with the challenges DanC also has a lot of [free game graphics](http://lunar.lostgarden.com/labels/free%20game%20graphics.html) posts.\r\n\r\n## So, What Can I Do?\r\n\r\nWell, you're free to do all of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Fork this repo and contribute to my ideas. Make them our ideas!\r\n2. Try to implement any of these ideas (don't forget to fork this repo and add your project under the idea's readme file, as well as mentioning this repo somewhere in your game)\r\n3. Add your own original idea so other people can contribute! Make sure to use our [template](BASE_GDD.md)\r\n\r\n## Final Words\r\n\r\nIf you need any guidance, here are some awesome links:\r\n\r\n- [Game Design Concepts](https://gamedesignconcepts.wordpress.com/): A free online course on the matter of game design!
