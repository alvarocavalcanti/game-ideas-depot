# PARANAMBUCO

## Key Thought

This concept was born during [Carnaval](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval), specifically Permabuco's carnaval and its myriad of folklore creatures. This folklore should be used as setting in a medieval-like action game.

The name, Paranambuco, is the native form of the word Pernambuco, a state in the northeast region of Brazil. As a trivia, it means "Perfurated Sea", due to a large reef formation in the state's northen shore.

The protagonist should be either a spearman, inspired by the [Caboclo de Lança](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caboclo_de_lan%C3%A7a), or a ninja/thief inpired by a [Frevo Dancer](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frevo).

The story would show the protagonist arriving in Paranambuco from the west, returning home from a distant errand, only to find it being ravaged by some evil creatures. These creatures are bring controlled by an evil wizard from another dimension, that tried to reach our dimension but didn't complete the transition properly, only his right hairy-leg (inspired by [The Hairy Leg](http://pt.fantasia.wikia.com/wiki/Perna_Cabeluda) is in our dimension, while the rest of his body is trapped between worlds.

Still, even with only a leg he can perform terrible spells and has imprisioned Paranambuco's king, [Momo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rei_Momo), and rain down fear amongst the people.

## Core Mechanics

The game could be either (1) an action RPG, with isometric view (Diablo inspired) or (2) a side scroller beat-em-up (inspired by Golden Axe.

## Level Design

As the protagonist approaches form the west, the landscape he faces would begin with the desert-like wilderness (Sertão), that would progress through all the other regions until arrive in the port/downtown area.

In every region the main enemies would be different, with a few of them returning in later stages.
