# REAL TIME TACTICS RPG

## Key Thought

A [Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-based_tactics) game in which the players' turns take place at the same time. The setting would be a medieval fantasy world, with the usual class-based charcters.

## Core Mechanics

The game would play just as any other tactics game, but instead of alternating turns, the players' turns would take place at the same time.

At the start of the match the players can agree upon a time-limit. 30, 45 and 60s seems to be a good range.

The play field would be tiled (either squares or hexagons, TBD).

Each unit would have a "field of action" (FoA), usually a few tiles in front of it. This FoA will be used to attack enemy units when the two overlap. This mechanic can be found on [Steambirds](http://www.steambirds.com/).

Each unit would also have one or more special skills. Each one of these skills should have a specific FoA, a number of charges and a cooldown. When activated during a turn, the skill would consume one of its charge, and each charge replenishes itself based on the skill cooldown.

Movement would play a crucial role, as each character would need to evaluate the FoA for every "game-turn" (the game-turns are the turns in which each character is moved across the board). For example, there could be a "Dash" skill, in which the character moves two tiles per game-turn instead of only one. That way it could avoid being in an enemy's FoA.

## Level Design

The levels would have several terrain types, that would have effects over the gameplay (blocking FoA, increasing DMG/DEF/AGI, etc).

A good example of this kind of level design can be found in [Lionheart Tactics](http://bit.ly/1Sw7Co8).
