# DUNGEON OF THE FALLEN

## Key Thought

The player starts descending/exploring the dungeon alone, and during her journey she finds other characters that have fallen before. The point is, those characters were part of other players party who have fallen in combat!

It can be viewed as a Dungeon-Crawler-meets-Pokem√≥n, given the discovery of new characters.

## Core Mechanics

It's a turn-based, party-based, dungeon-crawler.

The characters have classes and skills (not sure on the setting yet, but the play styles would adhere to the melee-ranged-caster archetypes).

When a character dies, it will be lay on the floor for until another player finds it.

As the player party may grow too big, the game difficulty shall adjust based on that, ensuring the challenge would keep up and that eventually the player will lose some characters and find new ones.

## Level Design

That party is tricky. How can we have a dungeon-crawler experience, aka random-generated levels, alongside with fallen characters on a given floor? Should they remain on the same spot they've fell, and the random algorithm take that into account? Or should they be placed on any other tile?

## Art Direction

Still to be defined.
